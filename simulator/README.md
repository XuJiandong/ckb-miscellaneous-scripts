# Simulator
The target of simulator is to compile, run code (which will be run on CKB-VM) on any OS and PC.
The we can use our favorite IDE and OS. It can only speed up development but don't skip necessary steps like testing on real CKB-VM.

## Change
There is only one change : All contents under simulator folder.
If you don't want to use the simulator feature, just ignore the folder.

## How to run
```bash
cd simulator
mkdir -p build
make
```

## TODO
Add other project targets to the simulator.
